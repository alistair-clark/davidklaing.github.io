    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>McMurtry, Lonesome Dove</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-11-22</em><hr/><p>The best novel I’ve read in years. I had never read a Western before, but I had heard that people get obsessed with this one, and I see why. McMurtry’s masterful use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech">free indirect style</a> allows you to fully inhabit the minds of each of his characters. Finishing the book is like saying goodbye to your friends. It’s rare for a book to make me cry or laugh, and Lonesome Dove made me do both.</p></div>'
