Imagine the rallying cries of a mind positivity movement:</p><ul><li>You are smart!</li><li>You are funny!</li><li>You are creative!</li><li>You are insightful!</li></ul><p>The metaphor can be extended further:</p><ul><li>Excessive studying as a ‘reading disorder’</li><li>Shitposting as taking no-filter mind-selfies</li><li>faux-casualness wrt punctuation &amp; capitalization as #iWokeUpLikeThis</li><li>Lurkers as people who are too ashamed of their physique to show themselves at the gym</li><li>Universities, Twitter, Great Books as things that promote unrealistic intelligence standards</li><li>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences as the Dove Real Beauty Campaign (in terms of moral messaging)</li><li>Second-brainism as calorie-counting (in terms of incessant metacognition about what you’re consuming)</li><li>High-end online courses as Peloton—embarrassingly bougie, probably unnecessary, but might actually work</li><li>Mind-dysmorphia: the unshakeable belief that some part of your mind is inadequate (otherwise known as impostor syndrome)</li></ul></div>'
