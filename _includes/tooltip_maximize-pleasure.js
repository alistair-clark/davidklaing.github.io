But thereâ€™s more to it than that:</p><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/affective-states-diffuse/" id="affective-states-diffuse">Affective states diffuse across time and across people</a></li><li>Learning happens faster when it is pleasurable</li><li>Healthy habits are easier to maintain when they are pleasurable</li></ul><p>The way to maximize pleasure is not to maximize pleasure at every single moment. This would lead to a downward spiral into behaviors that have delayed costs. Instead:</p><ul><li>Befriend happy people</li><li>Eliminate flow-stoppers</li><li>Create pleasurable rituals</li><li>Adopt a non-instrumental mindset</li><li>Connect new experiences to known sources of pleasure</li></ul><p>Strangely, pleasure is often neglected.</p></div>'
