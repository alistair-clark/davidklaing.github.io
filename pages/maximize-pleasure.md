The obvious reason to maximize pleasure is that, by definition, it feels good. But there's more to it than that:

- Pleasure diffuses across time and across people
- Learning happens faster when it is pleasurable
- Healthy habits are easier to maintain when they are pleasurable

Strangely, pleasure is often neglected.

The way to maximize pleasure is not to maximize pleasure at every single moment. This would lead to a downward spiral into behaviors that have delayed costs. Instead:

- Befriend happy people
- Eliminate flow-stoppers
- Create pleasurable rituals
- Adopt a non-instrumental mindset
- Connect new experiences to known sources of pleasure
