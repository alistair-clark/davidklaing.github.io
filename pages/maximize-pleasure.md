The obvious reason to maximize pleasure is that, by definition, it feels good. But there's more to it than that:

- <a id="affective-states-diffuse" class="internal-link" href="/affective-states-diffuse/">Affective states diffuse across time and across people</a>
- <a id="learning-happens-faster-when-it-is-pleasurable" class="internal-link" href="/learning-happens-faster-when-it-is-pleasurable/">Learning happens faster when it is pleasurable</a>
- Healthy habits are easier to maintain when they are pleasurable

The way to maximize pleasure is not to maximize pleasure at every single moment. This would lead to a downward spiral into behaviors that have delayed costs. Instead:

- Befriend happy people
- Eliminate flow-stoppers
- Create pleasurable rituals
- Adopt a non-instrumental mindset
- Connect new experiences to known sources of pleasure

Strangely, pleasure is often neglected.
