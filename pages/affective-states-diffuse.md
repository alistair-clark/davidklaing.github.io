An affective state, like pleasure, fear, or boredom, usually isn't localized to the moment when it is experienced. It diffuses into previous moments as an anticipation, and into subsequent moments as a memory.

An affective state also usually isn't localized to the person who experiences it directly. It diffuses into people they interact with, whether through deliberate empathy or through tacit contributions to the ambient mood.
