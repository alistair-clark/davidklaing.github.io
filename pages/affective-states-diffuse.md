Affective states have a way of diffusing into the past and future. You don't just enjoy a donut. You also enjoy the anticipation of the donut, and the memory of it.

Affective states also diffuse into the ambient mood. When you enjoy a donut, it makes you happy. Anyone you interact with will pick up on your happiness, and in some sense they'll get to enjoy the donut tooâ€”even if you don't share!

These are good reasons to <a id="maximize-pleasure" class="internal-link" href="/maximize-pleasure/">maximize pleasure</a> and befriend happy people.
