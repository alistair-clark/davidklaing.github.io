In 2019 I started playing blitz chess on [chess.com](chess.com). After my first hundred games, I had an ELO rating of about 650, which put me in the 2nd percentile among players on chess.com. In case you think I just got mixed up on the definition of 'percentile', no: I was better than 2% of players, and worse than 98% of players.

Eleven months later I peaked with a rating of 1258, around the 78th percentile.

1258 is a low rating among serious chess players. If I were to enter a tournament, I would probably lose most of my matches. However, compared to where I started, it's a massive improvement. Browse the pages below for the lessons I've learned:
