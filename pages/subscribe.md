I think of my newsletter as a forcing function to help me reflect every month on the books, ideas, and music that resonated with me the most.

There is deliberately no theme, but here is a brief list of phrases that have come up in past issues: metamodernism, adjacent disciplines, continuous publishing, network diffusion, tacit knowledge, solved conversations, taking history seriously, open sourcing of the self.

Join, if you dare!
