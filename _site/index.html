    content: '<h1>Atomic Habits</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-01-14</em><hr/><p>In an <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/north-star-podcast/daniel-gross-dreams-and-e8iC1HhrjDt/">episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell</a>, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was very wise:</p><blockquote><p>The definition of a habit, for me, is something that doesn’t require willpower. How can I build a large collection of habits that are healthy—that are correct—and save them to RAM in my head so that I don’t have to think about them? I would like to have that done by the end of my 20s. I’d like to be in a good place in terms of body composition, in terms of what I eat, in terms of how I work, so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about that stuff.</p></blockquote><p>I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and I got to thinking about which habits I might want to build or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear’s new book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits &amp; Build Good Ones</a>.</p><p>The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38 times better than when you started (\(1.01^{365} = 37.8\)). It’s often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible but consistent short-term differences. Hence, <em>atomic</em> habits: pennies that grow into a fortune.</p><p>Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cue</strong>. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.</li><li>The <strong>craving</strong>. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.</li><li>The <strong>response</strong>. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.</li><li>The <strong>reward</strong>. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.</li></ul><p>Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull to influence your behaviour. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear’s method.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>To build a good habit</th><th>To break a bad one</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cue</td><td>Make it obvious</td><td>Make it invisible</td></tr><tr><td>Craving</td><td>Make it attractive</td><td>Make it unattractive</td></tr><tr><td>Response</td><td>Make it easy</td><td>Make it hard</td></tr><tr><td>Reward</td><td>Make it satisfying</td><td>Make it unsatisfying</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you’ve done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then you might be familiar with many of these ideas already. This was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I think you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I’ll describe the ideas that I’ve implemented myself since reading it.</p><h2 id="habit-stacking">Habit stacking</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to start performing a new habit directly following another one that is already ingrained, you turn the old habit’s reward into the new habit’s cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven into your life.</p><p>Last year, I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. I’m more hydrated than ever.</p><h2 id="implementation-intentions">Implementation intentions</h2><p>In a study, two groups were asked to make to-do lists, but one group was given a small tweak that resulted in them accomplishing many more tasks than the other. They were told to write down with each task the time and location where they intended to complete it. They created an implementation intention. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious, this time by associating the action with a context that can be perceived as the cue.</p><p>I’ve started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card</em>, it’s <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning</em>. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task has helped me cross a number of them off.</p><h2 id="prime-your-environment">Prime your environment</h2><p>I first learned the value of this lesson three years ago when I lived in a tiny coach house in Welland, Ontario. I had always struggled to get out of bed on time, but I was teaching courses of my own for the first time and couldn’t afford to be late for class. So I came up with a solution. Each night before bed, I prepared my stovetop espresso maker and put it on the stove, alongside a clean mug and my phone (my alarm). When my alarm started ringing, I had to get out of bed and walk over to the stove to turn it off. Immediately, I would turn on the stove element and go back to bed for a snooze. Ten minutes later I would be woken again by the gurgling of the espresso, as well as the fear that it would boil over if I didn’t get up to turn off the element. My reward for getting up the second time was a fresh cup of coffee. Ever since then I’ve been completely cured of my snoozing habit.</p><p>As Clear explains, priming your environment for its next use is a great way to make a desirable behaviour more obvious as well as easier. After reflecting on this, I’ve been experimenting with a few changes:</p><ul><li>Pumping up my bike tires as soon as I get home from my evening bike commute. (This makes it easier to choose the bike as my mode of transport the next day.)</li><li>Repacking my gym bag as soon as I get home from the gym. (This makes it easier to go for a work-out whenever I feel like it.)</li><li>Filling up a big water jug next to my desk at the end of each work day. (This makes it easier to stay hydrated the next day. Note that putting the water jug there also makes my drinking habit more obvious.)</li><li>Placing a novel on my pillow after making my bed each morning. (I’m trying to build the habit of reading fiction before bed because I find that it helps me sleep.)</li></ul><h2 id="make-it-small">Make it small</h2><p>I’ve used various habit trackers for about four years now, and I’ve just about settled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.tasklife&amp;hl=en">TaskLife</a> as my favourite. I define a list of behaviours, and each day the app asks me whether I’ve done them. The beauty of it is that I can choose the frequency with which I want to perform each task, as well as the time period over which to calculate that frequency. It’s like Andy Matuschak’s system of <a href="http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/169043084412/successful-habits-through-smoothly-ratcheting">smoothly ratcheting targets with teeth</a>, minus a bit of smoothness and all the teeth.</p><p>The most common reason that I’ve failed to hit my target frequency has been the size of my tasks—they have been too hard. For example, it’s often hard to find the time and motivation for one full hour of writing, so I would often skip that habit. Even before reading Atomic Habits, I had recognized this problem and made some changes, like cutting 60 minutes of writing down to 10. But Clear offered many more ways to break down a complex or challenging behaviour into a task that can be completed in under two minutes. Since getting started is by far the hardest part of most habits, I decided to change all my habits in TaskLife to 2-minutes-or-under tasks as a way of making it easier to spend time on the things that matter to me. Here is the current list of questions that TaskLife asks me each morning about my previous day, along with the frequency with which I aim to complete those tasks over a rolling window of 21 days:</p><ul><li>Did you study at least one flashcard? (70%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of fiction? (70%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence? (55%)</li><li>Did you read at least one <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> article? (50%)</li><li>Did you play at least one chord on the guitar? (50%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence in your journal? (50%)</li><li>Did you go to bed by 9:30pm? (50%)</li><li>Did you send at least one message to a friend? (50%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of nonfiction? (40%)</li><li>Did you walk through the doors of the gym? (25%)</li></ul><h2 id="automate-it">Automate it</h2><p>Lastly, the easiest way to make a task easier is to delegate it to a machine. As a data scientist, I have obviously implemented this one before, too. I’ve automated my health insurance payments, my donations to charity, my bus pass top-ups, my <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">memorization efforts</a>, my <a href="https://www.fitbit.com">sleep tracking, my exercise tracking</a>, and my rebalancing calculations in my investment accounts. But there are always more things to automate, and Clear’s chapter on the subject got me to reflect on what else I could do. Since reading the chapter, I’ve set up automatic payments on all of my regular bills, and on my to-do list (with an implementation intention!) is the task of setting up automatic monthly transfers into my investment accounts.</p><p>In summary, I highly recommend Atomic Habits. If the topic of habit formation is new to you, I think this book is probably the best general resource you’ll find. And if the topic is already familiar, you’ll find that the book is a quick and engaging read with dozens of fresh ideas that you can consider implementing in your life.</p>'

    content: '<h1>How to use Roam as a slip-box</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-02-01</em><hr/><h2 id="the-slip-box-method">The slip-box method</h2><p>I’ve been experimenting with a new note-taking system. It’s called the “slip-box” method, so named because it originally comprised a literal box into which the notetaker would slip index cards.</p><p>The method excites me for two reasons. One: it’s a system for reflecting privately on the things I read—for checking my understanding, for improving retention of information, and for identifying questions to follow up on. Two: it’s a system for making connections between ideas. Creativity is mostly a matter of combining things in unusual ways, and the slip-box is a playground designed specifically for that.</p><p>So, what is it? Essentially, it is an incubation chamber for two types of written documents.</p><ul><li><em>Literature notes</em> are paraphrases of ideas and arguments encountered during research, complete with references.</li><li><em>Permanent notes</em> are the notetaker’s ‘original’ thoughts.</li></ul><p>Both types of notes are written in publishable-quality prose, and each note is meant to include enough detail that it could be read and understood on its own. The magic starts once you have enough notes that you can start connecting them to each other, prompting the creation of even more notes.</p><p>The inventor of the slip-box method, the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, connected his notes manually with an intricate system of IDs. But now we have software that can manage connections for us. Enter <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, a new note-taking power-tool that early users are going absolutely bonkers over. I too have joined the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult">cult</a>. Roam is special for many reasons, one of which is that it’s a perfect platform for building a modern slip-box. (Roam’s founder, Conor White-Sullivan, was heavily influenced by Luhmann.)</p><p>Still, I haven’t yet seen any accounts of how to use Roam as a slip-box. Despite being new to both Roam and the slip-box method, I thought I’d share my current system.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with Roam, you should go read Nat Eliason’s <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love it and How I Use It</a>. If you want to learn more about the slip-box method, read Sönke Ahrens’ book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes">How to Take Smart Notes</a> or Yuxi Liu’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017">summary of it</a>.</p><h2 id="roam-as-a-slip-box">Roam as a slip-box</h2><p>When I first started experimenting with the slip-box method in Roam, I had three questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Where should I write my notes?</strong> Should each note be its own page, or its own block? How should I manage note metadata, if at all?</li><li><strong>How should I distinguish between types of notes?</strong> How should literature notes be categorized separately from permanent notes, and how should both of them be categorized separately from other uses of Roam?</li><li><strong>How should I connect my notes to each other?</strong> By inline page links, by sub-blocks, or something else?</li></ol><p>My answers to these questions are in three Roam features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Daily Notes pages.</strong> I write all my literature notes and permanent notes as individual blocks in my daily notes. This makes it easy to track when I wrote each note, and means that other notes or thoughts can be conveniently added in parallel without needing to bounce around between pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tags</strong>: I have a tag for literature notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#litnote</code>) and a tag for permanent notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#permnote</code>). I include these tags, as well as any relevant reference material, at the end of the relevant blocks. When I want to see all my literature notes or permanent notes together, I can go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">litnote</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permnote</code> pages and see them in the linked references.</p></li><li><p><strong>Block references</strong>: Roam allows inline links to other pages, but sometimes you don’t want to link a block to a whole page, but simply to another block. For this I use block references: by typing double parentheses and searching for the original block of interest, I can insert that block into my current block at any point and add whatever additional information I want to include in my new note.</p></li></ul><p>You can see me using all three of these features in my daily notes page from January 18th:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/roam_slipbox/roam_daily_note.png"/></p><p>I like this system because it makes many things easy. I can compose, categorize, connect, and track my notes all at the speed of thought, without being prevented from using Roam for other purposes.</p><p>Still, my system will surely keep evolving. I don’t consider myself a Roam poweruser, so if you are one and you have suggestions, please do send them my way.</p>'

    content: '<h1>The Righteous Mind</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2016-09-01</em><hr/><p>This is a chapter-by-chapter summary of Jonathan Haidt’s book, <a class="external-link" href="https://righteousmind.com/" target="_blank">The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>How do people think about right and wrong? This is an empirical question, and <em>The Righteous Mind</em>’s primary goal is to answer it. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt tells the story of how his research led him to formulate Moral Foundations Theory, which claims that the human mind responds to combinations of six moral “taste receptors”: Care, Liberty, Fairness, Authority, Loyalty, and Sanctity.</p><p>The theory and its implications are presented in three parts. In Part I, Haidt shows that our conscious moral reasoning is done not to find the truth, but to preserve our reputations by justifying our intuitions. In Part II, he gives a full account of those intuitions and he shows how they differ across the political spectrum. In Part III, he argues that morality evolved through natural selection as a group-level adaptation; among our ancestors, the groups who were unified by collective moral principles were best able to turn resources into offspring.</p><p>In the final chapter, Haidt transitions from description to prescription, offering insights into how we might recognize the shortcomings of our own moral tribes, benefit from the most sensible ideas of other tribes, and work together to design a better society that acknowledges certain crucial facts of human psychology.</p><h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>Because this book aims to describe the psychology of morality, it might have made sense to title it The Moral Mind. However, “righteous” better captures a feature of the mind that is crucial for understanding why we hold ourselves to certain principles: we hold each other to those principles too. We are righteous, moralistic, and judgmental. These qualities are crucial for maintaining safe and productive societies, but they also lead to much enmity and moralistic strife within our communities. In order to parlay this strife into the mutually beneficial conversations that should be possible in democratic societies, we must first recognize that we are all hypocrites, that we all mean well, and that we will understand each other better if we first understand ourselves.</p><h3 id="part-1-intuitions-come-first-strategic-reasoning-second">Part 1: Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-1-where-does-morality-come-from">Chapter 1: Where Does Morality Come From?</h4><p>When Haidt decided to pursue moral psychology as a graduate student in the late 1980s, the field was dominated by rationalism, the theory that morality comes from reason. Rationalists believe that people become moral by learning that since they don’t like to be harmed, it must be wrong to harm others. Harm is thus central to rationalism; without it, there is no such thing as a moral dilemma. In cultures where people seem to condemn harmless acts (e.g. masturbation), rationalists assume those people must have supernatural beliefs (e.g. belief in hell) that make those acts seem harmful.</p><p>Haidt suspected that rationalism was wrong, so he conducted surveys across many cultures and reached three conclusions. First, morality varies greatly by culture, and it often concerns much more than harm. Second, people often have gut feelings about morality—often related to disgust—that they cannot justify but still hold to be true. Third, it can’t be true that morality is constructed entirely through a growing understanding of harm, or else people wouldn’t condemn acts that they themselves agree are not harmful. Thus, morality must come not from reason but from some combination of innateness and social learning. But even if this is true, a question remains: what are people doing when they reason about morality?</p><h4 id="chapter-2-the-intuitive-dog-and-its-rational-tail">Chapter 2: The Intuitive Dog and Its Rational Tail</h4><p>There are three hypotheses regarding the relationship between reason and intuition. One is found in Plato’s dialogue Timaeus, in which humans are described as perfect rational souls encased in imperfect emotional bodies. In Plato’s model, reason is the master and intuition is the slave. The converse of Plato’s hypothesis is that of the Scottish philosopher David Hume, who wrote in 1739 that intuition is the master and reason is the slave. A third option was put forth by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in 1786 that reason and intuition are co-rulers of the mind.</p><p>Drawing on findings from cognitive psychology, Haidt argues that Hume was right. To help readers understand how reason and intuition work together in the mind, he develops a metaphor: intuition is an elephant, massive and non-verbal, and reason is a tiny rider who sits on top, defending the elephant’s movements but relatively powerless to steer them. This explains why you can’t change people’s minds simply by refuting their arguments; those arguments were produced by the rider to justify what the elephant was already doing. To use another metaphor, “You can’t make a dog happy by forcibly wagging its tail” (48). Dogs wag their tails to communicate their happiness, and people use reason to communicate their intuitions.</p><p>Thus, in response to rationalism, Haidt presents the social intuitionist model of moral psychology, so named because it claims that morality comes from intuitions that are shaped by genetic predispositions and social learning.</p><h4 id="chapter-3-elephants-rule">Chapter 3: Elephants Rule</h4><p>Haidt presents six empirical findings that support the social intuitionist model:</p><ol><li>Intuitive judgments are powerful, instant, and constant. Experimental psychologists have long known that with every perception comes a tiny flash of either positive or negative affect, often so subtle that we don’t notice it. These flashes cause our elephants to lean one way or another, and our riders are always anticipating the next step.</li><li>Political and social judgments are especially intuitive. When asked to rate emotionally loaded words (such as “happy” or “angry”) as positive or negative, people are slowed down significantly when positive words are shown next to images of unattractive people, immigrants, or the elderly. Even if such judgments would not be endorsed by our riders, they still arise without conscious control.</li><li>Our bodies guide our judgments, often by activating feelings of disgust. When asked to make moral judgments in the presence of fart spray, people are more condemnatory. Associations with purity and cleanliness also affect moral judgments. When asked to make a series of judgments while standing next to a bottle of hand sanitizer, people become temporarily more conservative.</li><li>Psychopaths reason but don’t feel, and are severely morally deficient. Their elephants don’t react to shame, guilt, or human dignity, and so psychopaths feel no compunction when they behave in monstrous ways. Meanwhile, their riders serve their elephants just as well as anyone’s do, which means psychopaths can reason, plan, and even charm their victims. If the rationalists were correct, then psychopaths would be just as moral as the rest of us.</li><li>Babies feel but don’t reason, and have the beginnings of morality. As early as two months old, babies show evidence of their many intuitions when they stare longer at things that surprise them than at things that don’t. After being shown a short video of someone climbing a hill and being repeatedly pushed down by one person while being repeatedly helped up by another, babies are surprised to see the climber cozy up to the pusher rather than the helper. If the rationalists were correct, then babies would have no sense of right and wrong until long after they’d been personally harmed in a social environment.</li><li>In the brain, moral judgments happen in the right place at the right time to support social intuitionism. When asked to make moral judgments while attached to an fMRI scanner, people are shown to activate regions in their brains associated with emotional processing. High activity in these regions correlates with the judgments people ultimately make. It is as if we can watch the elephant lurch in real time.</li></ol><p>Elephants can respond to reason, especially when reason gives rise to new intuitions. But the best way to change elephants is not through argument, but through stories, art, or friendly social contexts, in which riders are not so obsessively protective of their masters.</p><h4 id="chapter-4-vote-for-me-heres-why">Chapter 4: Vote for Me (Here’s Why)</h4><p>The “social” part of the social intuitionist model comes from an insight of evolutionary psychology: in our ancestors’ mighty struggle to survive and find a mate, it was less important to know the truth than it was to maintain one’s reputation within the group. The rider is therefore much like a press secretary, ready at any moment to vindicate the president’s decisions. Haidt supports this view with five premises:</p><ol><li>We are obsessed with our reputations, even if we don’t realize it. In one experiment, people are told to talk about themselves into a microphone. While they speak, they can see a number on a screen that rises and falls according to an anonymous listener’s desire to meet them—or so they are told. In fact, the experimenter simply makes the number rise for some people and fall for others. Unsurprisingly, people’s self-esteem, as they describe it in the moments after, is greatly affected by the numbers they see, even when they go into the experiment believing they don’t care what other people think of them.</li><li>When we believe something, we look for evidence that confirms it instead of evidence that would falsify it. Look at the sequence “2, 4, 6.” What is the pattern? When people are allowed to test their hypothesis with other sequences, they typically say things like “8, 10, 12” or “100, 102, 104,” which both confirm their hypothesis: “three numbers that increase by intervals of two.” But that’s wrong. It doesn’t occur to people to guess “1, 6, 20” or “3, 2, 1.” If they had been looking to falsify their hunches, then they might have eventually reached the correct answer: “three numbers arranged in increasing order.” We look to confirm our ideas, not to put them on trial.</li><li>We are able to lie to ourselves, and believe those lies, whenever we want to conceal our own wrongdoing. In a series of experiments in which people attempt a series of math problems and then get paid for the number they manage to solve, the majority of people exaggerate when they are told to report their own result—even more so when they can destroy the evidence. So, most people cheat some of the time, but only to the extent that they can still convince themselves that their cheating was an honest mistake; the goal is to preserve one’s reputation, and lying is easier if you believe your own lies.</li><li>When evaluating a proposition we wish to believe, we tend to ask, “can I believe it?” Our riders are creative, and they can almost always come up with a reason for the answer to be “yes.” When evaluating a proposition we don’t wish to believe, we tend to ask, “must I believe it?” Our riders can almost always come up with a reason for the answer to be “no.”</li><li>When called upon to defend and support our groups, we activate regions of our brains related to pleasure and pain depending on the type of information we encounter. For example, an extreme partisan’s brain shows increased activity in areas related to negative emotion and punishment when they see their beloved leader acting hypocritically; but when they learn new information that exonerates their leader, the partisan gets a flash of pleasure as dopamine is released. Our brains don’t care about the truth. They care about our status within our groups.</li></ol><h3 id="part-ii-theres-more-to-morality-than-harm-and-fairness">Part II: There’s More to Morality than Harm and Fairness</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-5-beyond-weird-morality">Chapter 5: Beyond WEIRD Morality</h4><p>People in societies that are WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) are statistical outliers on many measures of morality. Most notably, they tend to see the world as a collection of discrete, autonomous individuals, which leads their morality to focus mainly on harm, oppression, and inequality. Most other cultures see the world as a collection of relationships that ought to be protected even at the expense of the individuals who make them up. In these cultures, and in religious and conservative sub-cultures in the West, morality involves a broader set of concerns, often involving community and divinity. Moral matrices—the collection of values shared by a particular community—bind people together and blind them to the possibility that there might be other legitimate ways to judge people and organize society.</p><h4 id="chapter-6-taste-buds-of-the-righteous-mind">Chapter 6: Taste Buds of the Righteous Mind</h4><p>There are two predominant systems of prescriptive ethics in Western culture: utilitarianism and deontology. Utilitarianism, developed by the 18th-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, says that moral behavior is that which maximizes the intensity, duration, and certainty of “hedons” (measures of pleasure) and minimizes those of “dolors” (measures of pain). Deontology, developed by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, says that moral behavior is that which anyone could will to become a universal law.</p><p>Though Haidt does not wish to discount the great value that utilitarianism and deontology have brought to Western society, he notes that both theories were developed by men who measured high on systematizing and low on empathy. Thus, these men were likely blind to certain crucial facts of human psychology. Haidt believes we can find a better starting point for both descriptive and prescriptive theories of ethics in David Hume, who acknowledged that morality involves numerous and often contradictory concerns that vary between cultures.</p><p>To figure out what those basic concerns are, Haidt and his research team borrowed a concept from cognitive anthropology called modularity. A module is an innate cognitive program that responds automatically to a particular perception—for example, one module is our ability to recognize faces. The first draft of any module is written in our genes by our evolutionary history, and then it gets tweaked by experience, sometimes through cultural learning. After reviewing the evidence of how people across cultures reason about morality, Haidt and his research team identified five initial candidates for modules that bear on moral psychology: care, fairness, authority, loyalty, and sanctity.</p><h4 id="chapter-7-the-moral-foundations-of-politics">Chapter 7: The Moral Foundations of Politics</h4><p>Haidt tells the full story of how he reasoned from our ancestors’ adaptive challenges to come up with a first draft of Moral Foundations Theory:</p><ol><li>Care/harm. This foundation helped our ancestors raise their children, who were completely dependent for the first few years of life. It gets activated when we see cute children or animals, especially if they are helpless and suffering.</li><li>Fairness/cheating. This foundation helped our ancestors form two-way alliances and benefit from cooperation while protecting them from cheaters. It gets activated when we feel gratitude toward those who help us, and anger toward those who hurt us.</li><li>Loyalty/betrayal. This foundation helped our ancestors form effective coalitions that could outcompete other groups that were less unified. It gets activated when we root for our favorite sports teams or swell with pride while singing our national anthem.</li><li>Authority/subversion. This foundation helped our ancestors establish beneficial relationships within hierarchies. It gets activated when we feel respect or fear for our bosses or parents.</li><li>Sanctity/degradation. This foundation helped to protect our ancestors from pathogens and unsafe food. It gets activated when we feel disgust or reverence for people or symbols, or when we shrink away from words or ideas that are taboo.</li></ol><h4 id="chapter-8-the-conservative-advantage">Chapter 8: The Conservative Advantage</h4><p>Survey data from over 130,000 people show that liberal voters value care and fairness above all other moral foundations, and that conservative voters value all five foundations equally. This explains why the Democratic Party often has such a hard time connecting with voters. Democrats can’t understand why poor rural Americans tend to vote Republican when it is the Democrats who want to distribute money more equally. The answer is that rural Americans value all six moral foundations, which are found in Republican rhetoric but not in Democratic rhetoric. As Haidt says, “Republicans understand moral psychology. Democrats don’t.” (156)</p><p>In the summer of 2008, Haidt was nervous that Obama’s two-foundation rhetoric might cost the Democrats the presidency. To help Democrats appeal to more voters, Haidt wrote an essay for Edge.org with the title, “What Makes People Vote Republican?” He contrasted two visions of society—one from the utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, who viewed the ideal society as one that prized individual autonomy above all else, and another from the French sociologist Émile Durkheim, who saw society as a set of valuable relationships that had developed organically over time as people learned how to suppress each other’s selfishness. Haidt explained in the essay that a Durkheimian society is a better fit for human psychology, and that the Democrats should try to capitalize on that fact as much as Republicans do.</p><p>Haidt received many emails from both liberals and conservatives after writing that essay, and they contained moral content that could not be easily categorized using Moral Foundations Theory in its current form. This led him to split the Fairness/cheating foundation into two separate foundations:</p><ol><li>Liberty/oppression. This foundation helped our egalitarian hunter-gatherer ancestors to rally against tyrannical alpha males who abused their power within the hierarchy of the group. For liberals, this foundation is almost as important as Care/harm, and it motivates them to advocate for sub-groups who appear to have been oppressed by traditional social structures.</li><li>Fairness/proportionality. This foundation helped our ancestors to maintain moral communities in which people were punished and rewarded in proportion to their deeds. This foundation is valued on both sides of the political spectrum, but slightly more on the right; conservatives resent liberal policies that appear to reward free riders.</li></ol><h3 id="part-iii-morality-binds-and-blinds">Part III: Morality Binds and Blinds</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: We are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-9-why-are-we-so-groupish">Chapter 9: Why Are We So Groupish?</h4><p>In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin proposed the idea that certain moral emotions were selected for because they gave a competitive advantage to groups who could better unify to turn resources into offspring. This hypothesis is called group selection, and it fell out of favor in the 1970s when the evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and George Williams argued that individual selection better explains why certain groups are more successful than others. To sum up their argument, “A fast herd of deer is nothing more than a herd of fast deer” (196).</p><p>The debate has been revived in recent years, and Haidt believes group selection provides the best explanation for many features of the mind. He presents four premises in defense of group selection:</p><ol><li>Throughout the history of life on earth, there have been around half a dozen “major transitions,” in which multiple individual carriers of genes bound themselves together to increase their collective chance of reproducing. This is what happened 2 million years ago when two prokaryotes combined to create the first eukaryote, which had multiple organelles that could then only reproduce when the whole cell did. This happened again when eukaryotes first combined to form multi-cellular organisms, and again when certain animals began cooperating to defend a shared nest, to feed offspring over an extended period, and to win conflicts against other groups. Good examples of these animals are ants and bees, which accomplish much more as colonies than they would as individuals. Another example is Homo sapiens after the development of agriculture.</li><li>Before our ancestors began to work well in groups, they must have had shared intentionality: the ability to recognize when other people wanted to achieve the same goals as them. This ability must have predated the development of language, since language is not a relationship between a word and an object but an agreement between people over a relationship between a word and a mental representation. Shared intentionality allows for the development of a moral matrix, and it explains how group selection could have bound together communities of non-kin humans in the same way that kin relations bound together hives of ants and bees.</li><li>Genes and culture coevolve. For example, early adult cattle-herders couldn’t digest cow milk because lactase, the enzyme which breaks down lactose, used to be produced only in children while they were young enough to breastfeed. But over many generations, the children whose lactase lasted longer than usual could benefit from cow milk for longer than their peers, which ultimately led to full communities of adults who could digest milk. The cultural evolution of cattle herding led to the genetic evolution of lactase-production in adults, which led to further creation of dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Similarly, it is plausible that cultural developments such as moral matrices led humans to choose more cooperative mates than they would have before, which made some groups more successful than others, and this in turn led to the genetic evolution of groupish behavior.</li><li>Evolution can happen fast, and it works on the level of groups. If you want to breed chickens to lay more eggs, it doesn’t make sense to breed the individuals that lay the most eggs, since those are usually the most aggressive ones in each cage, and the death rate would increase. If you instead select the most productive cages, the death rate will plummet in just a few generations, leaving you far more cooperative chickens and many more eggs. Similarly, our own ancestors faced several near-existential disasters that wiped out huge portions of the global population; it seems very plausible that the people who survived to pass on their genes were not the most aggressive individuals, but the most cooperative groups.</li></ol><p>Haidt does not claim that all of human psychology is the product of group selection—far from it. Rather, something like 90% of our mental modules resulted from individual selection over millions of years after our ancestors diverged from those of chimpanzees. But once our ancestors began to evolve alongside culture, they developed a few bee-like mental modules that bound them together into increasingly cooperative groups.</p><h4 id="chapter-10-the-hive-switch">Chapter 10: The Hive Switch</h4><p>Most of the time we pursue individual goals and maintain a strong sense of self. But in certain situations, we are apt to lose ourselves and feel that we are part of a greater whole. Haidt calls this the “hive switch.” It can be activated in many ways, such as when we feel awe in nature, when we take drugs such as LSD and MDMA, or when we move in synchrony with many other people (e.g. soldiers marching in time, or dancers at a rave).</p><p>Two recent findings in neuroscience support the idea of the hive switch and give some insight into how it operates. One is the hormone oxytocin, which makes us more trusting and more caring toward members of our in-groups. The other is mirror neurons, which activate when we perceive another person’s behavior and feel compelled to imitate them, especially when that person shares our moral matrix; this is why we automatically return our friends’ smiles, for example. The hive switch offers three insights for institutions that want to make their members more cooperative: increase similarity, not diversity; exploit synchrony; and create healthy competition among teams, not individuals.</p><h4 id="chapter-11-religion-is-a-team-sport">Chapter 11: Religion Is a Team Sport</h4><p>After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, a profusion of new books decried religion as a parasite that preys on unscientific minds. This view was promulgated by the New Atheists—Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens—who viewed religion primarily as a set of supernatural beliefs that directly cause all religious behaviors, from peaceful congregations to suicide bombings. The New Atheists saw that religion comes with the risk of great violence, and believed that there are better ways to glean its supposed benefits. So, they claimed that the world would be better without it.</p><p>Haidt argues that religion was a critical innovation that evolved through cultural group selection to produce much of what we now value in society. The reason the New Atheists fail to see this is that their model of religious psychology involves only two factors—belief and action—when there is in fact a crucial third: belonging. Haidt agrees with the New Atheists that the first step in creating the mental module for religion is in our tendency to see patterns where none exist (e.g. we see faces in the clouds). But where the New Atheists think the next step is that religion parasitically passes from one brain to the next, Haidt thinks the next step is the creation of moral capital. Whenever a religion is compelling enough to be shared by an entire community, it provides a framework for a shared moral matrix, which makes the group more cohesive and thus better at turning resources into offspring.</p><p>Evolutionary fitness isn’t the same thing as societal health, but perhaps religion deserves more credit as one of the forces that enabled our ancestors to cooperate so successfully on such a large scale. As Haidt points out, atheistic societies have never existed until recently (in parts of Europe), and they are downright horrible at turning resources (of which they have many) into offspring (of which they have few).</p><h4 id="chapter-12-cant-we-all-disagree-more-constructively">Chapter 12: Can’t We All Disagree More Constructively?</h4><p>What makes a person vote liberal or conservative? Drawing from studies of identical twins separated at birth, Haidt shows that most of the variance in the relevant personality traits is attributable to genetics, not to environmental factors. As people grow up, they construct life narratives that work in tandem with their innate tendencies and make them more or less likely to identify with various political narratives. Voters all across the political spectrum are psychologically normal, they all mean well, and they all have insights into how to build a healthy society.</p><p>In Haidt’s opinion, liberals offer two crucial insights that other groups tend to miss. One is that certain institutional norms can put sub-groups at a disadvantage, and we should work to make sure nobody is systematically oppressed in pursuit of the greater good. The second liberal insight is that governments should play some role in regulating the activities of corporations, which often produce harmful externalities. Haidt believes that libertarians, whose morality is singularly focused on the liberty/oppression foundation, have an important insight as well: markets are often miraculous. If governments are too zealous in their regulations, we end up paying far more for the products and services we all need, and we disincent innovation. Lastly, Haidt says that social conservatives have an important insight that liberals rarely understand: by undermining certain traditional social structures, we sometimes end up hurting the people we are trying to help.</p><p>To build a healthy society, we should aim not to wipe out ideologies that differ from our own, but to recognize that each political group is made up of good people who have important things to say.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Haidt concludes the book by reminding the reader of the central metaphors in each section. In Part I, he explained that intuitions come first, reasoning second. He advises that as a souvenir from this section of the book, we should keep a vision of ourselves and everyone around us as tiny riders on massive elephants. In Part II, he explained that there is more to morality than harm and fairness. As a souvenir from this section, we should keep a healthy suspicion of anyone who claims there is a single morality that is appropriate for all societies at all times. Lastly, in Part III, he explained that we are 90 percent chimp, 10 percent bee. As a souvenir from this final section, we should keep the image of the hive switch, which can engage our moral emotions and enable us to become selfless parts of a greater whole.</p>'

Its content is no less important than its form—in fact, its content is inextricable from its form. But here we will try to extricate it. Hofstadter would hate seeing these ideas strung out in an ugly skeleton, but even he would admit that most readers misinterpreted his book. In fact, he wrote a whole <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"><em>‘nuther</em> book</a> to clear up the confusion.

Some of these claims are vague enough to be nearly meaningless, but that’s what you get when you try to compress 777 pages into 34 propositions and you’re not a genius. Here goes nothing:</p><p><strong>P1.</strong> The self is the part of the mind that is conscious.</p><p><strong>P2.</strong> The mind is a product of the brain.</p><p><strong>P3.</strong> The brain is composed of neurons.</p><p><strong>P4.</strong> All neuronal activity is either transmission or inhibition of electrical impulses.</p><p><strong>P5.</strong> Electrical impulses carry information.</p><p><strong>P6.</strong> Information is that which can be translated from one form to another, such that the original form could be deduced from the translated form, given a decoding mechanism.</p><p><strong>P7.</strong> The purest way to study the translation and decoding of information is by studying a <em>formal system</em>.</p><p><strong>P8.</strong> A formal system is comprised of <em>axioms</em>, which are strings of typographical symbols (such as letters), and <em>rules</em> for manipulating the axioms to produce <em>theorems</em>, which are new strings of symbols.</p><p><strong>P9.</strong> A formal system can be devised such that its typographical symbols correspond to logical or arithmetical words in human language, such as “and”, “or”, “not”, “plus”, “equals”, etc, and such that the axioms and rules produce theorems which, when interpreted on the level of human language, express only true statements of number theory—e.g. “2+2=4”, “13 is prime”, “1 /= 0”, etc. Hofstadter calls this system Typographical Number Theory (TNT).</p><p><strong>P10.</strong> The symbols of TNT can be arranged so as to <em>express</em> (when interpreted on the level of human language) false statements of number theory (such as 1+1=4), but we should not be able to ‘decode’ (i.e. ‘prove’) these statements by running the typographical rules backwards to reach the axioms of TNT, because TNT has been deliberately designed to exclude false number-theoretical statements from the range of possible theorems. In other words, TNT has been designed to be consistent (no provable statement is false) and complete (all true statements are provable).</p><p><strong>P11.</strong> Rules for manipulating strings of typographical symbols can do nothing but add, subtract, multiply, or replace typographical symbols.</p><p><strong>P12.</strong> The addition, subtraction, multiplication, or replacement of typographical symbols is precisely what arithmetical operations do.</p><p><strong>C13.</strong> Any formal system can be translated such that its symbols are expressed as numbers and its rules are expressed as arithmetical operations. (This technique is called Gödel-numbering, after the mathematician Kurt Gödel, who invented it. Every string of TNT has a Gödel number.) (by P11 and P12)</p><p><strong>P14.</strong> Two numbers can have a relationship where one is typographically identical to the end of the other—for example, ‘4’ is typographically identical to the end of ‘1234’.</p><p><strong>P15.</strong> Mathematical proofs can be expressed in TNT.</p><p><strong>P16.</strong> Mathematical proofs that can be expressed in TNT have Gödel numbers.</p><p><strong>P17.</strong> Mathematical proofs end with the statements they prove.</p><p><strong>C18.</strong> The Gödel number of a mathematical proof in TNT would end with the Gödel number of the statement it proves. For example, the proof “premise 1, premise 2, premise 3; therefore, conclusion” might have the Gödel number ‘1234’, and “conclusion” would have the Gödel number ‘4’. (by P14, P15, P16, and P17)</p><p><strong>P19.</strong> When two Gödel numbers exist such that one is a proof of the other, and the other is identical to the end of the proof (like ‘1234’ and ‘4’), these numbers can be called a Proof Pair.</p><p><strong>P20.</strong> Statements of number theory can have free variables. For example, “<em>a</em> = 1” has the free variable <em>a</em>.</p><p><strong>P21.</strong> Since it is possible to express “<em>a</em> = 1” as a Gödel number, it is possible to insert that Gödel number into “<em>a</em> = 1” as the free variable <em>a</em>. (A statement with a free variable is a bit like a predicate with no subject, like “is a sentence fragment.” What we’re proposing here is like saying “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment.” Hofstadter calls this self-referential sentence the <em>Arithmoquinification</em> of <em>a</em>. The word comes from two ideas:</p><ol><li>For a sentence to “quine” is for a sentence to quote itself, as in “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment” (after the logician Willard Van Orman Quine)</li><li>The “Arithmo” in “Arithmoquine” signifies that a string of symbols is quining, but arithmetically, as in the Gödel number for “‘<em>a</em> = 1’ = 1”.</li></ol><p><strong>P22.</strong> You can make the statement, “There are two numbers such that one is the Arithmoquinification of the other.” (Like saying, “there are two strings of words such that one is the quinification of the other” or “there is a sentence which quotes itself”). This statement, like all number-theoretical statements, has a Gödel number.</p><p><strong>P23.</strong> You can make the statement that “There are no two numbers such that a) they form a Proof Pair (i.e. one is the Gödel number of the conclusion of a proof whose Gödel number ends in that first number, as in ‘4’ and ‘1234’, hypothetically), and b) one is the Arithmoquinification of the other (i.e. one is the same as the other except that it has inserted itself into its free variable, as in “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment”).</p><p><strong>P24.</strong> The string of TNT-symbols that expresses the above statement (in P23) has a Gödel number, and it has a free variable (namely the first number in the statement in P22), which means it can be Arithmoquined (i.e. its free variable can be replaced by itself). (Uh oh.)</p><p><strong>P25.</strong> If you <em>do</em> Arithmoquine the statement in P23, then you get the following: “There is no Proof Pair ending in the Arithmoquinification of the statement in P23.”</p><p><strong>P26.</strong> The statement in P25 means, “There is no proof of this statement.”</p><p><strong>P27.</strong> In other words, “I am not provable in TNT.” (Note that we have not <em>derived</em> this statement from the axioms of TNT. We’ve only <em>expressed</em> it, with the faith that all theorems of TNT are true statements of number theory and that all true statements of number theory are theorems of TNT.)</p><p><strong>P28.</strong> But if “I am not provable in TNT” is <em>true</em>, then all true statements of number theory are not represented (i.e. provable) in the theorems of TNT.</p><p><strong>P29.</strong> And if “I am not provable in TNT” is <em>false</em>, then that precise statement must be provable in TNT, which means that not all theorems of TNT are true.</p><p><strong>C30.</strong> (And this is Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem:) Any formal system that is sufficiently sophisticated to express truths of number theory cannot be both consistent and complete. (That is, as soon as it gains the power to refer to itself, TNT explodes! #pun) (by P19-P29)</p><p><strong>P31.</strong> (And here’s where the airtightness of Hofstadter’s argument also explodes, but beautifully:) There is a deep, abstract likeness between a) the information that is carried and manipulated by neurons and b) the information that is carried and manipulated by the rules of a formal system.</p><p><strong>P32.</strong> Selfless ingredients, when subjected to sufficiently sophisticated rules of manipulation, acquire the ability to indirectly refer to themselves and the system which produces them.</p><p><strong>P33.</strong> The electrical signals in human brains (selfless ingredients) are subject to (surely highly sophisticated) rules of manipulation via neurons.</p><p><strong>C34.</strong> Perhaps our sense of self—our subjective experience of the world, our feeling that there is an “I” who is perceiving everything—emerges in our brains as inexorably as self-reference emerges out of formal systems such as TNT, and in an analogous way. (by C30, P31, P32, and P33)</p><p>It’s not exactly a <em>convincing</em> argument… but at least it makes you feel smart. Really though, GEB is more about beauty than it is about linear cogency. 6 out of 5 stars. Read it!</p></hr>'

    content: '<h1>Deep Laziness — Sarah Perry</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-10-09</em><hr/><p>Laziness is usually frowned upon. We get paid, thanked, and admired for <em>producing</em>: for transforming chaos into order, for giving more than we take, for creating value rather than consuming it. Society doesn’t reward us for slacking off.</p><p>But not all laziness is bad. The kind of laziness we frown upon is shallow—guilt-ridden and opportunistic, like when we take a too-long break from work while scrolling through social media. Shallow laziness is the kind that you can’t quite settle into. But there is another flavor of laziness that is worth aspiring to—a kind that is wholesome, even exquisite. I’ve started referring to it as <em>deep</em> laziness, after reading Sarah Perry’s <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/06/deep-laziness/">post</a> on the subject.</p><p>To be deeply lazy is to be truly settled. Mainly, it is to eliminate the distance between your ideal and your actual self. It is not so much about relaxation or effort as it is about the absence of internal conflict. Where shallow laziness is failing to check the time and showing up late, deep laziness is walking exactly as slowly as you want to because you know you’re on time. Where shallow laziness is ordering pizza for the third night in a row, deep laziness is knowing how to make an easy and healthy meal that you love. Where shallow laziness is aimlessly browsing the internet all weekend, deep laziness is cozying up and watching the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy because you know that nothing else would make you happier.</p><p>These examples may suggest that deep laziness is a simple matter of getting your shit together enough that you can be self-assured in your indulgences. But it involves more than that. Perry recommends that we start by identifying the handful of behaviors that come to us most naturally, and then slowly elaborate on those behaviors in ways that preserve and reinforce the desirable feelings that the behaviors elicit.</p><p>For example, last year I started playing online <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Blitz">blitz chess</a>. The feeling that chess elicits for me is that of flow, a state of immersive focus on a problem. Flow is one of the feelings I enjoy the most, so in pursuit of deep laziness, I have slowly made a series of modifications to my chess-playing habits, both in my style of play and in the sub-variants of blitz that I play most often. Each of these modifications has made chess a better source of flow for me. As a result I feel more like my true self, more deeply lazy for chess’s presence in my life.</p><p>The point is not to do more things that elicit flow, per se, although I expect that many of you readers are like me in that flow is one of the feelings you pursue the most. The point is to reflect on the things you do when you’re bored, and ask, “what feeling am I chasing when I do this thing?” Having answered that question, you can let your behaviors evolve toward a richer, more resonant eliciting of that feeling.</p><p>Deep laziness is not deciding abstractly what sort of person to be, and then imposing your behaviors from the top down. Deep laziness is constructing yourself from the bottom up; it’s taking the self-enriching behaviors that are already present, and gradually deepening the grooves that they carve through your days.</p>'

    content: '<h1>The Aesthetic Bullseye</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-10-30</em><hr/><p>When I’m cooking a meal, writing a paragraph, or programming a piece of software, I usually have a personal standard of quality that guides my decisions. After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAhHDEtTD0">this vlogbrothers video</a>, I started referring to this standard as my ‘aesthetic target’. At its center is my ‘aesthetic bullseye’, which represents my concept of perfection.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/one_target.png"/></p><p>It’s tempting to remain unsatisfied until I hit my aesthetic bullseye. However, if I’m making something for others to enjoy, I need to consider their tastes as well as my own. And while this might seem to make my job harder, it actually makes it much easier. The reason is that not everyone’s tastes are exactly the same. If I superimpose other people’s aesthetic targets onto my own, my aesthetic bullseye disappears.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/multiple_targets.png"/></p><p>Even if I hit my own bullseye, I will miss the bullseyes of others. Realizing this has helped me to relax more when I’m struggling to achieve my own standard of perfection. Better to take more shots in the right general direction than to get caught in the perfectionist’s eternal refrain of “ready, aim, aim, aim, aaaaaaim…”</p>'

    content: '<h1>If you’re good, you need to talk more</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-07-09</em><hr/><p>One evening last fall, I was invited to play a board game called <a class="external-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-Avalon-Social-Deduction-Game/dp/B009SAAV0C" target="_blank">Avalon</a>. The game is a contest between a good team and a bad team. Through a series of public and private votes and discussion at the table, the bad people try to masquerade as good, while the good try to figure out who is good and who is bad.</p><p>I was assigned to the good team. I was the only one in the group who had never played before, so I took a backseat for the first few rounds, speaking little. To my surprise, this caused many players to suspect that I was bad.</p><p>“If you’re good,” <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/kevinakwok" target="_blank">one of them</a> said to me, “you need to talk more.”</p><p>I protested that bad people can speak just as easily as good people. How could I convince other players to trust me when any word I said might be a lie?</p><p>What I had failed to understand was that because of the burden of deception, talking is much more cognitively demanding for the bad people than for the good. It’s hard to maintain a consistent lie over the course of the whole game. This means that the best strategy for those on the good team is to consistently share their own thoughts and solicit those of all others. Not only does this shine a harsh light on the liars, but it also makes a greater amount of true information available for all good players to reason with.</p><p><em>If you’re good, you need to talk more.</em> I’ve come to realize that this idea goes far beyond the game of Avalon. In many facets of our lives, we draw from and contribute to an epistemic commons—a shared set of beliefs and norms that help us predict and understand the world and each other. In each facet, whether familial, social, professional, or civic, our lives are better when the epistemic commons is filled with true beliefs and productive norms. In fact, a healthy commons, with its high levels of mutual trust and perceived alignment, has the power to make our lives <em>much</em> better. Consider the expressive freedom and the unguardedness that were unlocked in the blossoming of your closest friendships.</p><p>But there are many ways the epistemic commons can become unhealthy. Like in Avalon, many groups of people contain bad actors who corrupt the commons for their own gain. Not only that, but the commons can degrade even without bad actors, simply because the world is complex and ever-changing. Ideas don’t have to be true to be catchy, and so misconceptions can spread through the commons like viruses.</p><p>What I came to understand after playing Avalon that night is that the health of an epistemic commons is maintained only under the active stewardship of good people—people who want to discover the truth and share it, who want their communities to operate under norms that allow everyone to flourish.</p><p>You might say that good stewardship isn’t so much about talking more as it is knowing when <em>not</em> to talk. You might say that it is often ineffectual, and sometimes counterproductive, to opine on subjects in which you are uninformed or undecided. Many of us have internalized the idea that we need to do our homework and think through our positions carefully before sharing, so that we don’t waste everyone’s time and attention.</p><p>I can certainly empathize with this view. If you’re like me, you often attend work meetings in which you feel doubtful of arguments people make. In these meetings I find it challenging to speak my mind, especially when I need to expend a lot of energy just to understand other people’s perspectives, let alone feel confident in my own.</p><p>But I have learned, through feedback and experience, that the less confident I am in my opinion, the <em>more</em> important it is for me to speak up. I think this is because when I’m feeling uncertain, it’s likely that other people are too. The more confident voices tend to dominate the conversation, and everyone else tends to nod along or just sit in silence. It’s far better to say “I don’t think I agree with this view, but I need some time to think about why” than to say nothing and <em>then</em> go off and do your homework. Silence is tacit agreement with the consensus. Revealing your uncertainty in real time helps to forestall harmful misunderstandings.</p><p>Moreover, whatever thoughts and ideas you do have, even if they are insufficient to solve the problem at hand, can provide scaffolding for others to find a solution. Assuming that others are searching for mutually beneficial ideas, why not provide them with as much data as possible?</p><p>Not everyone should adopt the “talk more” philosophy, of course. But I think many people are like me: they tend to err on the side of undersharing rather than oversharing. So, to those people: if you’re good, you need to talk more! Here are some concrete ways I’m doing this in my own life:</p><ol><li>Making an effort to be as open and responsive as possible with loved ones: reaching out more, responding faster, expressing dissatisfaction more readily, and offering praise whenever it occurs to me. I don’t think I had problems in this area before, but I believe that explicitly aspiring to this behavior has made me a better friend and partner.</li><li>Redistributing speaking time to quieter people when group conversations become lopsided. I’ve heard it said that if you’re in a conversation with one other person you should aim to speak 50% of the time. This generalizes well: in a conversation with five people, speak 20% of the time; with ten people, 10%; etc. When the Gini coefficient gets too high, be a conversational Robin Hood.</li><li>Being more vocal at work: speaking up more in meetings, writing more thorough documentation, leaving more detailed comments in code reviews, and sharing links that are relevant to company projects in the #random Slack channel. I work at a startup that seems poised to do big things, so I think my communicativeness within the company is one of the best opportunities I currently have to make a difference in the world.</li><li>Participating more actively on Twitter. This means writing more Tweets of my own, responding more frequently to others, and being more liberal in my use of the ‘like’ button. Like anyone, I need to be careful not to get too engrossed by social media, but having put some effort into curating my feed, I find that Twitter is a predominantly positive thing in my life.</li><li>Writing more blog posts<strong>.</strong> Writing takes a lot of work, and more often than not, what I write doesn’t bring me much recognition. But occasionally I hear a word or two of thanks for sharing an idea that helped or stimulated someone, and this is enough to convince me that my efforts are worthwhile.</li></ol><p>The sixth is still aspirational, but will hopefully be realized soon: play Avalon again! I’ve bought the game, but have yet to take the initiative to bring together enough people to play. Beyond the fact that it’s an absolute blast, I’ve been told there’s an additional benefit to playing regularly: you learn what it looks like when a person is trying to sabotage the commons rather than nourish it.</p><p>Luckily, real life is rarely as adversarial as Avalon, so we don’t usually need to be so suspicious of those around us. But I know of no experience that better demonstrates the challenges of collaborative truth-seeking, and the responsibility of good people to talk more.</p><hr><p>Thanks to Kevin Kwok for inspiring this post and for his insightful feedback on it. Thanks also to Meg Inman, Matthew Jordan, and Kevin Simler for their valuable feedback on earlier drafts.</p></hr>'

    content: '<h1>Covers shouldn’t just be for musicians</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-12-04</em><hr/><p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p><p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p><blockquote><p>“I’m working on a novel.”</p><p>“Cool, what’s it about?”</p><p>“It’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.”</p><p>“Oh, you mean like a fanfic?”</p><p>“No, I’m telling the story of Harry’s first year at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“But you’re not putting a spin on it or anything?”</p><p>“Nope, it’s the same as the story told in the original.”</p><p>“Word for word?”</p><p>“No, but arc for arc. Rowling’s story, my words.”</p><p>“Huh. Sort of like a cover.”</p></blockquote><p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. I’m not talking about adaptations, like Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By “covers”, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other people’s written works—comprehensive paraphrases.</p><p>Writing is hard. When you’re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. That’s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p><p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p><ul><li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menand’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson “used to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that way”.</li><li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, “I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.”</li><li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwell’s essay, “Politics and the English Language”. He says in an introductory comment, “The following is my attempt to update George Orwell’s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. I’ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.”</li></ul><p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original author’s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p><p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientists’ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefs’ recipes; painters reproduce other painters’ paintings. If you’re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writer’s work? I’ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/deep-laziness/" id="deep-laziness">Deep Laziness — Sarah Perry</a></li><li><a class="internal-link" href="/solved-conversations/" id="solved-conversations">Solved conversations — Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li><li><a class="internal-link" href="/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/" id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process">Research as a stochastic decision process — Jacob Steinhardt</a></li></ul><p>It’s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough “original”<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I don’t have to worry about writer’s block. If my own ideas aren’t flowing, I can just cover someone else’s.</p><hr><p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it weren’t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu.

    content: '<h1>Levels of Action — Alyssa Vance</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-08-28</em><hr/><p>What is a better use of time: improving the world, or improving your ability to improve the world?</p><p>The best model I’ve found for thinking about this question is in Alyssa Vance’s 2011 post, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/guDcrPqLsnhEjrPZj/levels-of-action">Levels of Action</a>.</p><p>When you use your existing skills to do direct work, you are taking a “Level 1 action”:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose that you go onto <a href="http://mturk.amazon.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>, open an account, and spend a hundred hours transcribing audio. At current market rates, you’d get paid around $100 for your labor. By taking this action, you have made yourself ​$100 wealthier. This is an example of what I’d call a Level 1 or object-level action: something that directly moves the world from a less desirable state into a more desirable state.</p></blockquote><p>When you invest time in improving your skills, you are taking a “Level 2 action”:</p><blockquote><p>[…] suppose you take a typing class, which teaches you to type twice as fast. On the object level, this doesn’t move the world into a better state—nothing about the world has changed, other than you. However, the typing class can still be very useful, because every Level 1 project you tackle later which involves typing will go better—you’ll be able to do it more efficiently, and you’ll get a higher return on your time. This is what I’d call a Level 2 or meta-level action, because it doesn’t make the world better directly—it makes the world better indirectly, by improving the effectiveness of Level 1 actions.</p></blockquote><p>What is the use in categorizing actions in this way? For one thing, it helps you to understand whether you are overweighting actions of a certain level. As Vance points out,</p><blockquote><p>The most important difference between Level 1 and Level 2 actions is that Level 1 actions tend to be additive, while Level 2 actions tend to be multiplicative. If you do ten hours of work at McDonald’s, you’ll get paid ten times as much as if you did one hour; the benefits of the hours add together. However, if you take ten typing classes, each one of which improves your ability by 20%, you’ll be 1.2^10 = 6.2 times better at the end than at the beginning: the benefits of the classes multiply (assuming independence).</p></blockquote><p>If you only ever take Level 1 actions, you will never improve your throughput. However, if you only ever take Level 2 actions, you will never accomplish <em>anything</em>, since even the largest number multiplied by zero is still zero.</p><p>There is no simple answer to how much you should prioritize each level of action, but there are a few helpful heuristics.</p><p>One is to get “both the benefits of Level 1 and Level 2 actions […] by going out and doing Level 1 things that one hasn’t done before.”</p><p>The first time I took public transit on my own, in grade 8, I stood at the wrong stop for 45 minutes, trying to flag down express buses as they soared past me. When I was finally picked up, I had no clue how to alert the driver of my stop, so when the time came I nonchalantly walked up to him and said, “this is me.”</p><p>The more of a beginner you are at any given task, the more you’re in Level 2 when doing that task. But I still made it to swim practice! As educational as the experience was, I accomplished a Level 1 action.</p><p>Nowadays I think about this in my professional life: which useful tasks could I complete at work that I’ve never done before? Usually the first thing a programmer learns to do is print the phrase “hello world.” What is the ‘hello world’ of conducting interviews? Of project management? Of graphic design?</p><p>Another heuristic is to focus more on Level 2 actions early in life, and gradually shift to Level 1 as you get older. It makes sense that most people go through vocational training as young adults rather than after retirement: the earlier you multiply, the larger the total sum.</p><p>Consider also that Level 2 isn’t the highest level of action, since there are actions you can take which improve your ability to improve your ability to affect the world—meta-meta-level actions. Vance illustrates this point well (with a bit of a nasty jab):</p><blockquote><p>Witness the hordes of lawyers who spend thirty years on the Level 1 action of working at a law firm, three years on the Level 2 action of getting a law degree, and three minutes on the Level 3 action of deciding what to do after college.</p></blockquote><p>Some questions I’m reflecting on as I consider the ideas in this post:</p><ul><li>What levels of action do I tend to spend the most time in?</li><li>What levels of action should I spend more or less time in, given my stage of life?</li><li>What are some actions I could take that would span multiple levels?</li></ul>'

    content: '<h1>The personal PhD</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-07-16</em><hr/><p>Lots of people aspire to do a “personal master’s degree,” but I’ve never seen anyone describe an attempt to do a “personal PhD.” With the caveat that I haven’t done a PhD myself, it appears to me that many components of it are achievable outside a traditional program. I think people who are drawn to PhD programs should consider whether they can assemble the key ingredients on their own.</p><p>As far as I can tell, these are the key ingredients:</p><ol><li>A broad understanding of the history and methods of your discipline, and a deep, constantly renewing understanding of a specialty within that discipline.</li><li>Several peer-reviewed publications.</li><li>Frequent feedback from an expert mentor over a period of several years.</li><li>Extensive experience teaching and evaluating beginners.</li><li>Completion and publication of a large research project that makes an original contribution.</li></ol><p>None of these things are easy to do outside a PhD program, but they’re all possible. You can learn independently: materials are abundant and usually free, so in many disciplines the only barriers to understanding are time and discipline. You can publish papers in industry journals or conference proceedings. You can find an expert mentor. You can volunteer to lead workshops, or find a part-time teaching position. And as long as you can acquire the tools and the data, you can do original research.</p><p>Of course, people consider doing PhDs for different reasons. Different end-goals may call for different mixtures of ingredients. But if you’re considering one at all, it’s worth asking yourself: for whichever parts of the experience are most appealing to you, is there a DIY version that might be just as good?</p>'
